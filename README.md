# Verified Transformations for Convex Programming (supplementary material)

There are many Lean code snippets in my thesis, mainly examples of problems modeled using [CvxLean](https://github.com/verified-optimization/CvxLean/tree/main).
The main ones can be found here and reproduced by building this repository.
I have also formalized some small proofs that are presented informally in the main text.

I also show several definitions and theorems using `#check`, and add some relevant links.
One can navigate to them using the following shortcut: (`Cmd` / `Ctrl`) + click.

### Installation 

Install CvxLean's requirements (Lean, Rust, and MOSEK).
Then run the following command.
```
./build.sh
```
After that, open the project in VSCode.
