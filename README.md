# Verified Transformations for Convex Programming (supplementary material)

There are many Lean code snippets in my thesis, mainly examples of problems modeled using [CvxLean](https://github.com/verified-optimization/CvxLean/tree/main).
The main ones can be found here and reproduced by building this repository.
I have also formalized some small proofs that are presented informally in the main text.
